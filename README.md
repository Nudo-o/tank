# tank
**Implementation of the tank as in the game "diep.io".**

I want to note that I use my own library gt.js so you won't be able to directly use code that has the advantages of using gt.js. But here it is quite well shown how you can create a similar tank and shots from it.

**WASD** - Movement<br>
**Mouse click** - Shooting
